var name = 'John'; //string go in between quotes
console.log(name);//we can use the name variable
//it will retrieve the value that is stored in that variable
//when you inspect element and go to console you can see the line it came from in our file
//very useful later


//created very 1st var!

//let's declare our next var!


var lastName = 'Smith';// when we declare a var name that has 2 parts, we use camel charset
console.log(lastName);

//3rd variable

var age = 26;//did not use quotes, not a string, number/integer
console.log(age);

//data types:
    //Primitive data types: these are not objects, simple data types


//numbers strings boolean undefined null
//numbers: floating points numbers, dec + integer
//string: sequence of characters, used for text
//boolean: logical data type t or f
//undefined: data type of var which does not have a value yet
//null: also means non existent


//JS has something called Dynamic Typing:
  //meaning js can figure out the data type of a variable on its own!
  //we can change the data type of a var later in our code

var fullAge = true;
console.log(fullAge);

//logging is for debugging, hunt down bugs, we log our data/var to the console
//great tool to output the data instead of having to worry to write to our webpage
