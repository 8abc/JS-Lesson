//Arrays:


//We sometimes had diff variables for diff people
//If we can bundle these into one single variable that would be awesome....
  //we can:

var names = ['john', 'jane', 'mark'];
//before we made 3 different variables
//instead we have an array with 3 strings

var years = [1999, 1969, 1948];

//Now to access the values in the array we do the following:
//we use the [] and put the order number of the element we want to retrive
//In JS arrays are 0 based:
  //1st element has index number of 0

console.log(name[0]);
//john
